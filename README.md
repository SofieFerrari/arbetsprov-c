# Backend Sample of Work - Rock, Paper Scissor Game

## The Project:

In this project I created a RESTful API for the game of Rock, Paper, Scissor.
Player one requests a game-ID and Player 2 can be added to the game by using this ID. The game can only be played once, a win is counted as a win, and so is also a tie.
Create a new ID to play a new game.

## Tecnology Stack:

Node.js
Express
CORS
@babel

## Installation & Setup DOWNLOAD:

1. Download the zip file and extraxt it to your desired location.
2. Thought the terminal, navigate to the project directory:
   cd path/to/your/arbetsprov

## Running the Application:

### To start the application in dev mode, run:

npm run dev

### To start the application in production mode run:

npm start

## API Endpoints

This API exposed the following endpoints:

Create a new game - post (retun id)
Join a game - put? post?
Make a move - post (name and move)
Check status (who won? return winner)

## Note that this game can only be played once. For a rematch, please create a new game-ID.
